# Overview

**Drv7SegQ595** is a single-class Arduino library for driving a multiplexed 7-segment display using
a single 74HC595 shift register IC and 1 to 4 transistors.

## Concept

It's like [Drv7Seg2x595](https://github.com/ErlingSigurdson/Drv7Seg2x595), but it uses GPIO-driven transistors instead of a second IC.
